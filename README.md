# Fantasy Team Tracker

This project was created as a front-end application to demonstrate good UI design and human-computer interaction.
This app does not yet have back-end functionality.

The main languages used were Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX.

Since this was designed as a mobile application, there are a few steps to take in order to view it in Chrome on a phone view:

* Right click anywhere on the page and click 'Inspect'

* On the top right, click the 'Toggle Device Toolbar button'

* On the top middle, change the device from 'Responsive' to one of the provided devices in the dropdown.

Thank you for viewing this application!
